The AeroGear UnifiedPush Server
-------------------------------

Now that all the Google work is done, we are now ready to setup the link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unified-push-server[UnifiedPush Server], so that it can be used to connect to CGM for sending messages later in the tutorial.

AeroGear UnifiedPush Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The _AeroGear UnifiedPush Server_ defines a logical _abstraction_ for Mobile Applications that have support for different Push Networks. Its _Push Applications_ can have different "Variants". For this tutorial we'll need to create a _Push Application_ which will contain one Chrome Packaged App Variant.

Details on the AeroGear UnifiedPush Server are discussed link:../../ups_userguide/[here].

Once you have run through the link:../../ups_userguide/server-installation[Installation] and link:../../ups_userguide/admin-ui/#_login_and_landing_page[Login] Procedures, meet me back here.  I'll wait.

Ok, now that your back, lets continue.

For the purpose of the guide, we will be using the AdminUI and assuming that you have followed the previous guide to login and setup your UnifiedPush Server environment.

=== Register a Push Application

Now that we are logged in, let's create a new _Push Application_.

In the Navigation panel, the +Applications+ icon brings you to the management section for PushApplications:

Now click the +Create Application+ button which brings up a dialog to provide a name and an optional description:

Now that we have our new Chrome Application, you will notice that we have no variants.  Time to create one.  Click on the "No variants" icon to get started

_Remeber: Variants are the actual application_

=== Register an Chrome Packaged App Variant

Time to register our Chrome Packaged App variant.

Click on the _Add Variant_ button

Choose the _Chrome_ option and then enter in the _clientId_ and _clientSecret_ parameters to the Google API Client ID and Client Secret you obtained earlier from the Google API console.  Also, update the _refreshToken_ parameter with the refresh token you obtained from the OAuth2 Playground

The variant has been created.  There is an _Example Installation_ link that will be useful for our next section.

The server is now configured. Time to link:../chrome-app[create a Chrome Packaged Application] that will use the AeroGear JS library to connect to the UnifiedPush server and start receiving notifications.
