title: Send a Push Notification
---

Now that we have the sample application running, it is time to use the _AeroGear UnifiedPush Server_ for delivering a _Push Notification_ message.

== Simple Sender

A bit earlier you received a _pushApplicationID_ and a _masterSecret_ after the successful registration of the _Push Application_. These ID's are used for sending a _broadcast_ message to all _registered_ devices (installations). Now, on a command line issue the following _CURL_ command:

[source,c]
----
curl -3 -u "{pushApplicationID}:{masterSecret}"
   -v -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json"
   -X POST -d '{"message": {"alert":"Push Notification"}}'
   https://SERVER:PORT/CONTEXT/rest/sender
----

If all goes well, you should see the message payload being displayed on screen:

== You are done

That's all you need to use the _AeroGear_ project for sending and receiving _Push Notifications_ from a Chrome Packaged Application.
