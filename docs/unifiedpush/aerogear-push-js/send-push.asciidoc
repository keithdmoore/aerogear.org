== Sending messages

Now that we have the web application running and we have registered the 'mail' endpoint on the UnifiedPush server, it's time to send notifications. A bit earlier you received a _pushApplicationID_ and a _masterSecret_ after the successful registration of the Push Application. These IDâ€™s are used for sending a message to all registered SimplePush installations, per channel.

On a command line issue the following _CURL_ command:

[source,c]
----
curl -3 -u "{PushApplicationID}:{MasterSecret}"
   -v -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json"
   -X POST
   -d '{"simple-push": "version=123"}
   }'

https://SERVER:PORT/CONTEXT/rest/sender
----

Notice the _simple-push_ object in the payload. It contains a version number. The AeroGear UnifiedPush Server will perform an HTTP PUT update on the SimplePush server. This will cause the SimplePush server to send the push notification to all connected web clients, that belong to the used PushApplication.

[NOTE]
If you want to send another push notification to that endpoint, make sure you are increasing the version number (e.g. version=124 or version=125 in this case)! Using the same version for that given endpoint does not cause a push notification to be sent to the client.

You should see again the 'mail' notification being received:

== You are done

UnifiedPush server integrates with SimplePush and treats it as another mobile variant, in par with iOS and Android platforms that we currently support. Now sending notifications to your mobile clients means that your web applications can benefit too, either running on a mobile device or on a desktop. As a final note, the SimplePush specification is an on-going effort from Mozilla and currently marked experimental, so some of the APIs outlined in the guide may change or deprecate. The AeroGear project pays close attention to the development of the SimplePush specification and will incorporate changes as soon as become available.
