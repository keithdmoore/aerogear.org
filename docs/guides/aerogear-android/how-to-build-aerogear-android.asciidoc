=== Building

AeroGear's Android libraries are built as apklib projects using Maven, but Google doesn't ship all the needed libraries to maven central. You need locally deploy them using the link:https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer[maven-android-sdk-deployer].

```
git clone git://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer.git
```

cd $PWD/maven-android-sdk-deployer/platforms/android-19
