== Converting a Mobile HTML5 + REST Web App to a Hybrid App with Apache Cordova

This article will build upon the HTML5 https://github.com/jboss-jdf/jboss-as-quickstart/tree/master/kitchensink-html5-mobile[kitchensink quickstart], which we have converted to an http://incubator.apache.org/cordova/[Apache Cordova] based hybrid application.

What does all of that mean? Basically, this takes our https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-17326[HTML5 + REST] / http://www.jquerymobile.com"[jQuery Mobile] based web app and converts it to a native app for both iOS and Android. Currently, these apps will need to be built separately but in the future, we hope to provide a single build step for all supported mobile OS types. These concepts can be applied to the conversion of most HTML5/JS based web apps by just replacing the specific paths described in this article with paths that match your environment.

Download the converted application from https://github.com/jboss-jdf/jboss-as-quickstart/tree/master/kitchensink-cordova.

=== Repo Structure
Before getting started, it is important to note the structure of this repo and how it may affect your environment. In order to avoid duplicating both files and effort, the web app assets (HTML, CSS, JS) files have been housed in a separate folder called *shared*. In there, you will find a folder called *www* under which are the files. In order for this structure to work during your builds, a symbolic link to the *www* folder from each of the app's respective *www* folders must be created. In iOS, that is in the */ios/* folder and in Android, the symbolic link is in the */android/assets* folder.

=== System Requirements & Setup

link:../CordovaSetup[Cordova Setup] details how to set up your system to use Cordova.

=== iOS

==== Generate the XCode project using Cordova

Before we can build the app, and run it in the simulator or on a device, we need to create the project using Cordova.

[NOTE]
==============================
These steps are based on the link:http://docs.phonegap.com/en/edge/guide_getting-started_ios_index.md.html[Getting Started with iOS] guide for Cordova.
==============================

First, we need to create a new project. In a terminal, change into the kitchensink-cordova directory. Now, run Cordova to generate a project:

    cordova create ios org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensinkcordova KitchensinkCordova

Now, we need to create the symbolic link from `shared/www` to `ios/www`. First we remove the generated `www` folder then we create the symbolic link:

    cd ios
    rm -rf www
    ln -s ../../shared/www www

==== Import the project into XCode

Open Xcode, then select File -&gt; Open, then browse to the *&lt;repo-folder&gt;/ios/* folder and select the *KitchensinkCordova.xcodeproj* file. Click Open and you should see the project in XCode. 

[TIP]
====
If the *www* folder is not visible in the project or appears broken, that means your OS was unable to create the symbolic link from the file in the repo. If it is there but XCode shows it as missing or broken, all you have to do is create the symbolic link. Now you can just open Terminal, navigate to the *&lt;repo-folder&gt;/ios/* folder and then create the link like this:

[source,bash]
----
$ rm -rf wwww
$ ln -s <full-path-to-your-repo>/shared/www www
----

This will create the symbolic link and the folder should be fixed in XCode. If the folder is missing, there is a little trick that you have to do to get XCode to see it. First in the *&lt;repo-folder&gt;/ios/KitchensinkCordova* delete the www file which came from the repo if it exists. Then create a new folder called *www*. Now from finder, drag that folder into XCode and drop it on the KitchensinkCordova project on the left side of the window. A dialog window should appear and you want to select the option to add the folder as a reference. You should now see that folder listed in XCode. This is where it gets tricky. Go back to Finder and delete the *www* folder you just created. It will now show as broken in XCode but that's ok. In Terminal, create the symbolic link using the instructions above and you should be ready to go.

====

Next, open *AppDelegate.m* and add the following code to the beginning of the file just after the *@synthesize* statement to create a custom User-Agent string that we will check for in our app's main JavaScript file:

[source,objective-c]
----
+ (void)initialize {
    // Set user agent
    NSDictionary *dictionnary = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithObjectsAndKeys:@"Kitchensink Cordova Webview iOS", @"UserAgent", nil];
    [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] registerDefaults:dictionnary];
    [dictionnary release];
}
----

Finally, we must add an exception in Cordova to allow it to access external urls. Open *Cordova.plist* and add the following url to *ExternalHosts*:

    html5-aerogear.rhcloud.com

image:../img/iosCordovapList.png[Cordova pList]

That's it! You should now be ready to see it in action. 

Change the *Target* in the *Scheme* menu to *KitchensinkCordova* and select a device:

image::../img/xcode_kitchensink_simulator.png[]

Click the Run button in the upper left corner of XCode and the iOS Simulator should start and you will see the Kitchensink app running. Going to the list page should show you the list of members from http://html5-aerogear.rhcloud.com[html5-aerogear.rhcloud.com], which is the http://openshift.redhat.com[OpenShift] hosted version of the HTML5 kitchensink quickstart. You can also add to that member list from the add screen of the app and also on that add screen, you will see a note referring to your current network connection. That note is proof that Cordova has given you access to native APIs.

image::../img/network.png[iOS Simulator shoing network connection output]

==== Building the App for Devices
After you are able to successfully test your app with the iOS Simulator, it is time to test it on a device. As stated above in the system requirements, this is going to require an Apple Developer account, an iOS development certificate (downloaded to your machine) and a provisioning profile (also downloaded and installed in XCode) for the device(s) you plan to test on. For more information about these requirements, visit the http://developer.apple.com[Apple Developer] site. Now, on to the steps to deploy to your device.

One important note about the provisioning profile is that the when you create your App ID, it must match the App ID of the app exactly or it won't work. For this quickstart, we have used *org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensinkcordova.KitchensinkCordova* as the App ID so you must also create that App ID in your profile and create a provisioning profile for it if you wish to test this quickstart.

image::../img/appID.png[Example App ID]

Once you have your provisioning profile set up and installed, open your project in XCode again. In the center pane, on the left side under Projects, click on your project (in this case KitchensinkCordova). Now, to the right of that, at the top, click *Build Settings*. In the build settings, there is a section named *Code Signing*. Next to the *Code Signing Identity*, click to change the value to your certificate which should be in the list if you followed the steps from the Apple Developer site on installing your certificate. Your certificate name should look something like *iPhone Developer: Kristopher Borchers (&lt;some_random_string&gt;)*.

Next, make sure your device is attached to your machine, then in XCode, near the top-left corner of the window, you will see the name of your app, followed by the device or simulator that it will run on. Click the device name and select your connected device. Click Run, and it should deploy to and run on your device. That's it!

=== Android Build

==== Generate the Eclipse project using Cordova

Before we can build the app, and run it in the simulator or on a device, we need to create the project using Cordova.

[NOTE]
==============================
These steps are based on the link:http://docs.phonegap.com/en/edge/guide_getting-started_android_index.md.html[Getting Started with Android guide for Cordova].
==============================

First, we need to create a new project. In Eclipse, go to *File -> New -> Other...*, and select *Android Application Project*:

image::../img/android_new_project_1.png[]

Enter *KitchensinkCordova* as the project name, and *org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensinkcordova* as the package:

image::../img/android_new_project_2.png[]

Click *Next >*. You can accept the defaults on this screen, and hit *Next >*:

image::../img/android_new_project_3.png[]

Click *Next >*. You can accept the defaults on this screen, and hit *Next >*:

image::../img/android_new_project_4.png[]

On the next screen click *Next >* to create an activity. Call the activity *KitchensinkCordova*:

image::../img/android_new_project_5.png[]

Now, hit *Finish*.

[NOTE]
====
You may need to click *Next* after creating the activity to install the relevant Android libraries.
====

Copy *<CORDOVA_HOME>/lib/android/cordova-2.0.0.jar* to *libs/*.

Copy *<CORDOVA_HOME>/lib/android/xml/* to *res/xml/*.

Now, open up the *KitchensinkCordova* class in `src`, alter the class to extend `DroidGap`, and change the class to look like:

[source,java]
----
public class KitchensinkCordova extends DroidGap {
    
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

        // Loads the URL with HTML application
        super.loadUrl("file:///android_asset/www/index.html");
    }

    @Override
    public void init() {
        super.init();

        WebSettings settings = this.appView.getSettings();
        settings.setUserAgentString("Kitchensink Cordova Webview Android");
    }
}
----


Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file and paste the following permissions between the `<uses-sdk.../>` and `<application.../>` tags.

[source,XML]
----
    <supports-screens 
        android:largeScreens="true" 
        android:normalScreens="true" 
        android:smallScreens="true" 
        android:resizeable="true" 
        android:anyDensity="true" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_LOCATION_EXTRA_COMMANDS" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CONTACTS" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_CONTACTS" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" /> 
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BROADCAST_STICKY" />
----

This gives the app all permissions, which you will want to lock down at some point. Locking down the application is out of the scope of this guide.

Now, support orientation changes by pasting the folowing inside the `<activity>` tag:

[source, XML]
----
    android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden|screenSize"
----

Now, we need to create the symbolic link from `shared/www` to `android/assets`.

[source, Shell]
----
    cd assets
    ln -s <PATH_TO_KITCHENSINK_CORDOVA>/shared/www www
----

Finally, just like the iOS version, we must add an exception in Cordova to allow it to access our external url.  Open res/xml/config.xml, and add the following line:

    <access origin="html5-aerogear.rhcloud.com"/>

That's it! You should now be ready to see it in action. Near the upper left corner of Eclipse, there is a button that looks like a little phone with a green Android on the screen, click that and it will launch the Android Virtual Device (AVD) manager.

image::../img/avdbutton.png[AVD Button]

If you have not yet created a virtual device, you should do so now. The link:../CordovaSetup[Cordova Setup] guide details how to do this. This sample was built for the Android 2.1 SDK for maximum compatibility with current devices but should work on any 2.x or 4.0 SDK. The sample was not tested on the 3.x series.

image::../img/avd.png[AVD selection window]

Now that you have a virtual device, select it and click Start. On the following screen, keep the default settings and click Launch and the simulator will start. Now that you have a running simulator, go back to Eclipse, close the AVD window, then right-click (control+click) the project in the left pane, and go to *Run as -&gt; Android Application*. Select your simulator from the list of running devices, and click OK. This will launch the app in the simulator and you are off and running.

image::../img/androidSim.png[App running in Android simulator]

==== Building the App for Devices
Running the app on your Android device is even easier. First, make sure your device has USB debugging enabled. This is usually done by going to *Settings -&gt; Applications -&gt; Development -&gt; USB debugging*. Once you have done this, make sure there are no virtual devices running, then connect your device to your computer with your USB cable. In Eclipse, go to Run -&gt; Run (or click the green "Play" button in the toolbar) and the app should start on your device. If you still have the simulator running, the app may start in the simulator. If this happens, or you would like to have both the simulator running and your device connected, you can use the method outlined in the section on running your app in the simulator. When you get to the part on selecting a running device, both your simulator and your physical device should be in the list and you can select from there.

==== Android FAQ
* When trying to run the project, I receive a message similar to "Android requires compiler compliance level 5.0 or 6.0. Found '1.4' instead." What do I do?
** As recommended by Eclipse, "Please use Android Tools &gt; Fix Project Properties" will fix this issue
* I receive the error "Unable to resolve target 'android-7'", what do I do?
** This is due to an incorrect SDK version. This app was built for Android 2.1 and should work on any 2.x or 4.0 device. In order to build the project though, you will need to have the Android 2.1 (API 7) installed using the Android SDK Manager which can be found in the Eclipse toolbar.
* Why do the transitions look so shaky or choppy?
** jQuery Mobile has some issues with Android and transitions. The Android browser has some issues with these transitions which causes a flicker or jump during or at the end of the animation. This is further exagerated in the emulators. You can read more about jQuery Mobile's work with page transitions on Android here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3217
